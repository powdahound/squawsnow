# @SquawSnow Tweeter

A small project to tweet new snowfalls at Squaw Valley ski area via @SquawSnow. Note that this project isn't officially affiliated with or maintained by Squaw.

It scrapes their [snowfalls page](http://squawalpine.com/skiing-riding/weather-conditions-webcams/squaw-valley-snowfall-tracker) and sends out a tweet whenever a new entry is detected.

A hacked together PHP script running on an old webhost powered these updates from 2010-2014 until I decided to rebuild it in node.js and run it on Heroku. As my first "real" node project I'm sure there are some odd coding practices at work here. :)
